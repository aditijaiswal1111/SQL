# Data Mining Assignment - PostgreSQL

## Overview
This assignment involves utilizing PostgreSQL with the Sakila database, a fictional database mimicking a DVD rental store. The task is to perform various queries on the database to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions related to film rentals, customer behavior, revenue generation, and transaction analysis.

## Setup
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and the Sakila database set up on your system. You can find the Sakila database schema and data [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

## Assignment Questions
1. **Top 10 Most Popular Films**: Query the film table to find the top 10 most popular films based on the number of rentals, displaying film name and rental duration.
2. **Top 3 Films Among Customers who Rented "TEQUILA PAST"**: Identify the top 3 most popular films among customers who have also rented the film "TEQUILA PAST", displaying film id, film name, rental count, and rating.
3. **Total Revenue by Film Category**: Calculate the total revenue generated by each film category and list the category name along with total revenue and average revenue per film in each category.
4. **Customers with Transactions over $10**: Use a nested select query to find the first name and last name of customers who paid more than $10 in any transaction, and count the number of such customers.
5. **Top 10 Customers by Rental Count and Amount Spent**: Determine the top 10 customers who have rented the most films, including their total rental count and the total amount they've spent on rentals.
6. **Comparison with Large Language Model (LLM)**: Request solutions from a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or BARD for each problem and compare them with your solutions.

## Usage
1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using the command line interface.
2. Execute the provided SQL queries for each problem statement to obtain the desired results.

## Files Included
- **sakila.sql**: SQL script to create the Sakila database schema and populate it with data.
- **queries.sql**: SQL script containing queries for each problem statement.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the assignment and instructions.

## Requirements
- PostgreSQL
